## Environment variables

The `.env.dist` file describes the mandatory variables for the application, and it can be committed to version control. This provides a useful reference and speeds up the on-boarding process for new team members, since the time to dig through the codebase to find out what has to be set up is reduced. 

> **_NOTE:_** Please make sure that you have enough required variables in the `.env.dist` file and create your `.env` file before running the application.
